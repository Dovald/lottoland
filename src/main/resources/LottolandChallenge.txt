Back-end Java Challenge
First Part
    • Write a program to play rounds of Rock, Paper, Scissors (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors).
    • There will be 2 kinds of players, one should always choose randomly, the other should always choose rock. 
    • The program will be a web, with a single view containing the next elements:
        ◦ "Play Round" button that will play an automatic round
        ◦ Field showing the number of rounds played by that user so far.
        ◦ Table showing the rounds played, with 3 columns: what 1st player chose, what second chose, and the result of the round (that could be player 1 wins, player 2 wins or draw)
        ◦ There will be a button: "Restart game" that will set round count for that user to 0 and also clean the table.
    • Many users accessing the URL in their own browsers should be able to play the game independently, with their own counters and rounds info tables.

  Second part
    • Add a second simple view with the next information: 
        ◦ Total rounds played
        ◦ Total Wins for first players
        ◦ Total Wins for second players
        ◦ Total draws
    • These totals should consider all the rounds of all the games played by all users. (even if we clicked in "Restart button", these games should be considered as well)
    • Don't use database, just keep the information you need in memory.

Technical requirements
    • JVM 11 or higher
    • The code should have high test coverage.
    • The use of maven, git, java11, etc will be evaluable.  
    • Keep it simple - remember: we're not looking for the perfect "correct" solution, but a basis for discussion and development.
    • Approach: ideally "test-driven"

Please use local git (initially a “git init” in the project directory), so that we see a little of your working methods. Archive task and send it to us via provided greenhouse link in the email or feel free to use any public git repositories.

We are looking forward to seeing your solution!
